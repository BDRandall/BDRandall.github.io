        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img alt="A headshot photo of Benjamin Randall" src="selfie.jpg">
        <p>
          I'm Benjamin Randall, a computer science major and game development enthusiast. I'm currently working
          on establishing my own indie game development studio called Eternal Stellar Games (ESG). With a strong passion
          for creating immersive gaming experiences, I'm dedicated to bringing unique and captivating projects to life.
        <P>
          My journey in the field of computer science began with my pursuit of a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer
          Science with a Minor in Games and Simulations, as well as a Certificate in Startup Entrepreneurship at Miami
          University. During my studies, I developed my skills in programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, SQL, and
          R, and gained proficiency in development environments such as Eclipse, Rider, CLion, IntelliJ, PyCharm,
          VSCode, and Visual Studio.
        <P>
          With a focus on game development, I have utilized powerful engines like Unreal Engine 4 & 5 and honed my
          skills in 3D modeling using Blender. This expertise allows me to create captivating and visually stimulating
          games.
        <P>
          As I pursue my entrepreneurial ambitions, I am establishing Eternal Stellar Games as an indie studio dedicated
          to delivering high-quality and immersive gaming experiences. Through ESG, I aim to develop and publish
          engaging projects that captivate players and leave a lasting impression.
        <P>
          I am continuously exploring new technologies, pushing the boundaries of creativity, and collaborating with
          like-minded individuals to bring unique game concepts and other software possibilities to fruition.
          With my strong background in computer science, my entrepreneurial drive, and my dedication to the gaming
          industry, I am confident in the success and impact of Eternal Stellar Games.
