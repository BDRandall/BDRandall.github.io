      <h2>About Software Projects</h2>
      <p>Here, you can find information about my software projects. I will showcase some of my notable projects, along
        with descriptions and features. Most of my projects are based in Python, Cython, Java, or C++. My software
        projects are typically tailored towards users with command line experience.</p>

      <p>If you have ever used linux command line, you've probably used the GREP command. The GREP command is a very
        robust and powerful tool to search for text within text based files.
        Where it lacks however is reading text from files that aren't text based, like PDF's, Microsoft Word documents,
        and more. This is where "Grep-more" comes in. "Grep-more" is a
        command line tool that allows you to search for a keyword in file types that are text based or binary based. The
        program is currently being written in a mixture of Python, Cython, and C++. </p>
