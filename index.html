      <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ben Randall, a computer science major with a deep passion for both game development and software projects. I
        believe that programming offers endless opportunities for creativity and problem-solving.
      <p>
        As a computer science major, I have developed my skills in various programming languages and gained expertise in
        software development. I enjoy taking on the challenge of building robust and efficient software solutions that
        meet specific needs and enhance user experiences.
      <p>
        In addition to my focus on game development, I also love working on small software and programming projects.
        Whether it's building utilities, crafting innovative solutions to everyday problems, or exploring new programming
        concepts, I find joy in creating software that simplifies tasks and improves efficiency.
      <p>
        On this website, you will not only find a showcase of my game development projects but also a collection of small
        software and programming projects that I have worked on. These projects demonstrate my versatility and passion for
        exploring different aspects of computer science and software development.
      <p>
        I invite you to browse through my portfolio and explore the diverse range of projects I have created. Each project
        represents a unique opportunity for me to delve into new technologies, learn new concepts, and refine my
        programming skills.
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring the exciting world of both game development and my
        software projects through my website!
      <p>
